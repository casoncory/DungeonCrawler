# DungeonCrawler
Small Dungeon Crawler game made in unity for a game development class.


Main Idea:

Create a multi-level single-life (rogue-like?) dungeon-crawler game. The dungeons will be created procedurally using a depth-first search algorithm. The player can collect items which help survivability and kill enemies who drop loot. Items include the following: weapons, health potions, armor, and various tools such as keys and torches.
